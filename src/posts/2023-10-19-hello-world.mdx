# Insert Cliche "Hello World" Title Here

> <small>All tech-oriented blogs must make this joke; it's required.</small>

> <small>The other required part: *opinions are my own.*</small>

<br /><hr /><br />

Hello to every tech enthusiast, curious coder, and security aficionado out there!

First, a hearty welcome to my little corner of the internet. If you've skipped the bio, I'm Pat, an infosec professional, Penn State grad, and avid learner. I've worn multiple hats in the realm of information security across various industries, and now* I'm also donning the writer's cap.

*For context, I've written blog posts for my employer before; this is my personal blog.

### Why Start This Blog?

In an age saturated with content, one might wonder, "Why add to the noise?" The answer is simple: I believe in the power of shared experiences. Every post on this blog stems from a personal journey — a challenge faced, a project built, or a curious tangent pursued. While I've been lucky to learn from countless professionals, blogs, and forums, I felt it was time to contribute to that collective knowledge (disclaimer again, on my personal blog this time).

<br />

### What Can You Expect?

1. **Deep Dives into Security**: Using Python in defensive security, designing cloud-based SIEM automation workflows, practicing the art of creating or tuning detection rules, setting up lab/test environments... we'll explore the nuances of security engineering together.
  
2. **Adventures Beyond Security**: While security is a significant chunk of what I do, I'm also intrigued by the broader landscape of technology. Expect some off-beat tech musings and adventures. For example, check out <Link target="_blank" href="https://jcompanion.app/">JCompanion</Link>, a project where I started to explore TypeScript and modern web frontend frameworks like React (<Link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/s3cpat/JCompanion">code</Link>).

3. **A Blend of Formal & Casual**: As the <Link href="/bio">bio</Link> suggests, not every post here will be a scholarly article. Sometimes (or even often), it might just be me ruminating about a curious piece of code or a funny story.

### How's This Blog Set Up?

For those interested in the technicalities:

- **Tech**: TypeScript + Next.js + next-mdx-remote + React + MUI's Joy + gray-matter + Feed (for RSS/feeds) + dayjs (I'm sure this list will either grow or shrink over time, but at the time of writing, this is accurate)
  
- **Hosting**: I host this blog on GitHub pages, chosen for its simplicity and easy CI/CD.
  
- **Theme**: The sleek design you're experiencing? It's the I-Didn't-Make-One theme - I want to work on substance for this blog before going too hard on the style!

### Join Me on This Journey

So, here we go — the beginning of what I hope to be a long and enriching journey. If any of my posts resonate with you or if there's something you'd like me to explore, feel free to send me a note via:

Your feedback and curiosity will shape this blog as much as my experiences.

Until next time, happy coding, and stay secure!
